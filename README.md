# 100DaysOfSwiftUI
# Repo to Track my process trough the 100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge by Paul Hudson

  -) 22.11.20 Finished Day 1,2 and 3 Basic Stuff, but still learned something new
  
  -) 23.11.20 Finished Day 4 Learned about Loops
  
  -) 24.11.20 Finished Day 5 Felling very comfortable with all Different Functions now. Started with Day 6, First Day of Closures, sounds Scarry but it wasnt that hard. Just Repeat it often enough then it becomes more Logic to my Brain 

 -) 25.11.20 Closures Closures Closures, Finished Day 7 Closures Part 2. Since there are so many different ways of writing them i will repeat it tomorrow.

 -) 26.11.20 Day 8 Done. Learned about Structs, Methods, stored and computed properties.
 
 -) 27.11.20 Day 9 Done. Learned about access control, static properties, and laziness
 
 -) 28.11.20 Day 10 Done. Stil 90 Days to go :-) Finally understand the difference Between reference Types and value Types. Also learned when we use the override keyword. Mutable Func can only be used at structs, when you change a value of a struct. 
 
 -) 29.11.20 Finished Day 11, Learned about Extensions and Protocols. Note for me: Extensions cannot have stored properties i must use computed properties.
 
 -) 30.11.20 Finished Day 12, feeling comfortable with Optinals now.
 
 -) 01.12.20 Today i did not continue with Day 13 of Hacking with Swift, instead i worked at my Project, the LocationTimeTracker, as well as took the #AdventOfCode Challege, and solved the first riddle.
 
 -) 02.12.20 Today also no HWS, instead i did the AdventOfCode Challenge Day 2. Had to learn a lot about Strings to finish this challenge.
 
 -) 03.12.20 After two days break with HWS. i continuad today and finished day 13, 14  and 15, the consolidation days. I also Started with the first Videos of Swift UI. Puh. If you only UIKit, SwiftUI seems like a huge change.
 
 -) 04.12.20 Finished Day 16 and 17 and uploaded mi first SwiftUI Project. SwiftUI starts to make sense for me, but there is stil so much to learn, cant wait for the next days.
 
 -) 07.12.20 After 2 days break i finished today Day 18 up to 22. Making the Project Guess the Flag was a lot of fun. Uploaded the Project Guess the Flag with the challeges included. For me the challanges today were pretty easy. I continued working at the Location Time Tracker, i learned about Map View Overlays and how to add a circle to the map.
 
 -) 08.12.20 Today i continued at my Location Time Tracker app. Played around with different ways of letting the user pick a color.
 
 -) 09.12.20 Finished Day 23 Views and Modifiers of 100DaysOfSwiftUI. Created my Own View stuct and View Modifer. For me itÂ´s stil a bit strange that the order matters when you add several modifiers. To create a costum modifers i hat to create a struct forst that conforms to the ViewModifier Protocol and with that modifier i can add an Extension the the View Struct.
 
 -) 10.12.20 Day 24 done! Views and modifiers: Wrap up. As always reptition is the key.
 
 -) 11.12.20 Today i took a day off of 100DaysOfSwiftUI because i had a lot of work in my Daytime Job.
 
 -) 12.12.20 Finished my first Milestone Project. It wasnt difficult to build i just wasnt 100% shure about how the game should work. Later i will come back to this project and will make it look nice.
